  abstract = {Background:A Soil-transmitted helminthic infection (STHIs) remains a notable health problem in resource-limited countries.Objective:This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the overall prevalence of STH infections in Ethiopia.Methods:Articles written in English were searched from online public databases. Searching terms taken separately and jointly were ?prevalence,? ?soil-transmitted helminths? ?nematode,? ?Geo-helminths,? ?roundworm,? ?Necator,? ?Ancylostoma,? ?Ascaris,? ?Trichuris,? ?hookworm,? ?whipworm,? ?S. strecoralies,? ?associated factors,? and ?Ethiopia.? We used STATA version 14 for meta-analysis and Cochran?s Q test statistics and the I2 test for heterogeneity.Result:From 297 reviewed articles 41 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of STH infections in Ethiopia was 36.78\% Ascaris lumbricoides had the highest pooled prevalence 17.63\%, followed by hook worm12.35\%. Trichuris trichiura 7.24\% when the prevalence of S. strecoralies was 2.16\% (95\% CI: 0.97-3.35). Age, sex, residence, family education level, lack of shoe wearing habits and open defecation were identified as risk factors for STH infection. Eating unwashed and uncooked fruit and vegetables increased the risk of STH infection by 1.88 times while untrimmed finger nail and lack of hand washing habits increase the risk of STH infection by 1.28 and 3.16 times respectively with 95\% CI.Limitation:Lack of published studies from Afar, Gambela, Somali, and Benshangul gumuz regions may affect the true picture. The other limitation is that the search strategy will be restricted articles published only in the English language but there might be articles that published using another language.Conclusion:Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworms and Trichuris trichiura, are the most prevalent soil-transmitted helminthes infections in Ethiopia. Age, sex, residence, family education level, lack of shoe wearing habits Open defecation untrimmed finger nail and lack of hand washing habits significantly associated with STH infection. When eating unwashed, uncooked fruit and vegetables were not significantly associated with STH infection. Strategic use of anti-helminthic, health education, and adequate sanitation, taking into account this epidemiologic information is helpful in the control of STH infections in Ethiopia.},

This study assessed the prevalence of STH infections and associated factors among schoolchildren in Durbete town, northwestern Ethiopia. Data about the sociodemographic and socioeconomic status of the children were collected using a questionnaire and stool samples were diagnosed using thick Kato-Katz smear. STH infection was more common among school-age children in Durbete town. Hookworm was the most frequent helminth species detected. The prevalence of STH infection was more in children who did not practice wearing shoes and washing hands before eating and in those who were older in age. Deworming of school-age children in the study area would be important. In addition, provision of health education about helminths and the importance of wearing shoes and washing hands before eating would be important to reduce the burden of STH infection in the study area.},

Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing (RS) technologies assist data mapping and analysis, and the prediction of the spatial distribution of infection in relation to environmental variables. The influence of socioeconomic, environmental and soil characteristics on hookworm infection at the individual and household level is explored in order to identify spatial patterns of infection in rural villages from Zenzelema (Amhara region). Inhabitants greater than 5 years old were recruited in order to assess the presence of STH. Socioeconomic and hookworm infection variables at the household level and environmental variables and soil characteristics using RS were obtained. The dominant STH found was hookworm. Individuals which practiced open defecation and those without electricity had a significant higher number of hookworm eggs in their stool. Additionally, adults showed statistically higher hookworm egg counts than children. Nonetheless, the probability of hookworm infection was not determined by socioeconomic conditions but by environmental characteristics surrounding the households, including a combination of vigorous vegetation and bare soil, high temperatures, and compacted soils (high bulk density) with more acidic pH, given a pH of 6.0 is optimal for hatching of hookworm eggs. The identification of high-risk environmental areas provides a useful tool for planning, targeting and monitoring of control measures, including not only children but also adults when hookworm is concerned.},

  abstract = {Background Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are one of the most common infections affecting underprivileged populations in low- and middle-income countries. Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm are the three main species that infect people. School children are the most vulnerable groups for STH infections due to their practice of walking and playing barefoot, poor personal hygiene, and environmental sanitation. However, evidence is limited in the study area. So, this study aimed to assess the current prevalence, infection intensity, and associated risk factors of STHs among school children in Tachgayint woreda, Northcentral Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among school children of Tachgayint woreda from February to May 2021. The study participants were chosen via systematic random sampling. Stool samples were collected from 325 children and examined using the Kato-Katz technique. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 23. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify the potential associated factors for STHs. An adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) was used to measure the magnitude of the association. A P-value {$<$}0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The overall prevalence of STHs in this study was 36.0\% (95\% CI: 30.5\textendash 41.2\%). Ascaris lumbricoides are the most prevalent species 89 (27.4\%) followed by hookworm 14 (4.3\%) and Trichuris trichiura 10 (3.1\%). All of the infected school children had light-intensity of infections with the mean of eggs per gram (EPG) being 464.53. Lack of shoe wearing habit (AOR = 4.08, 95\% CI: 1.29\textendash 12.88) and having untrimmed fingernail (AOR = 1.85, 95\% CI: 1.06\textendash 3.22) were identified as risk factors for STH infections. Conclusions More than one-third of the school children were infected with at least one STH species and this indicates that STHs are still a health problem among school children in the study area. Therefore, periodic deworming, implementation of different prevention strategies, and health education programs should be regularly applied in the area.},

Globally, the housing need is most acute in Africa, where the population will more than double by 2050. However, existing data on housing quality across Africa are limited primarily to urban areas and are~mostly recorded at the national level. Here we quantify changes in housing in sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2015 by combining national survey data within a geostatistical framework. We show a marked transformation of housing in urban and rural sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2015, with the prevalence of improved housing (with improved water and sanitation, sufficient living area and durable construction) doubling from 11\% (95\% confidence interval, 10\textendash 12\%) to 23\% (21\textendash 25\%). However, 53 (50\textendash 57) million urban Africans (47\% (44\textendash 50\%) of the urban population analysed) were living in unimproved housing in 2015. We provide high-resolution, standardized estimates of housing conditions~across sub-Saharan Africa. Our maps provide a baseline for measuring change and a mechanism to guide interventions during the era of the Sustainable Development Goals.},
